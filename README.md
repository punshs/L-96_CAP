# Computer-Assisted Proof for Lorenz 96 Model Hypoellipticity

This repository contains the Jupyter notebook `elementary_matrices_proof.ipynb`, which implements the computer-assisted proof (CAP) described in Appendix C of the paper:

**"Non-uniqueness of stationary measures for stochastic systems with almost surely invariant manifolds"**
by Jacob Bedrossian, Alex Blumenthal, and Sam Punshon-Smith.


## Purpose

The notebook verifies a key algebraic generation property required for establishing the hypoellipticity of the transverse projective process associated with the stochastically forced Lorenz 96 (L96) model under degenerate forcing (forcing only every third mode). Specifically, it demonstrates that the Lie algebra generated by the matrices `{M_k : k ∈ I}` (representing the linearization of the L96 dynamics restricted to the transverse space) is `sl(H^⊥_I)`, the special linear Lie algebra on the transverse space.

## Methodology

The proof relies on:
1.  Representing the linearization matrices `M_k`.
2.  Exploiting shift invariance properties.
3.  Using symbolic computation (Sympy) with exact rational arithmetic to compute iterated Lie brackets up to a certain depth.
4.  Verifying that the span of the generated matrices contains a known generating set for `sl(H^⊥_I)`.

The computation is performed for N=12 (dimension of transverse space = 8) and N=9 (dimension = 6), and the structure ensures the result holds for larger N (N=3K, K>=3).

## Usage

The notebook `elementary_matrices_proof.ipynb` contains the Sympy code and can be executed to reproduce the verification steps. Ensure you have the necessary Python environment with Sympy installed.
